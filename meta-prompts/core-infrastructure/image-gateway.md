  <task>
    Create a new AI coding-agent skill called "image-gateway".
  </task>

  <storage>
    Store the skill wherever this harness loads skills from, such as
    ~/.claude/skills/image-gateway/SKILL.md or ~/.codex/skills/image-gateway/SKILL.md.
  </storage>

  <job>
    The skill generates or edits images through the OpenRouter API with one command.
    It should use saved preferences so routine image requests do not require per-call setup.
  </job>

  <inputs_to_collect>
    <input>Preferred default image model.</input>
    <input>Default output directory.</input>
    <input>Where the OpenRouter API key lives. It must be read from an env file, never written into the skill.</input>
  </inputs_to_collect>

  <requirements>
    <requirement>Define trigger conditions for direct image-generation requests and for other skills that need image generation.</requirement>
    <requirement>Document the current OpenRouter image API request shape.</requirement>
    <requirement>Include a working curl or script example that reads the key from the env file.</requirement>
    <requirement>Store the collected preferences in the skill.</requirement>
    <requirement>Include per-image cost notes for the selected default model.</requirement>
    <requirement>Tell other skills to call this skill instead of writing their own image API code.</requirement>
  </requirements>

  <verification>
    Generate one image with the saved defaults, show me the result, then update the skill with anything learned from the test.
